## Features

#### Mechanical Additions:
- A Key System has been implemented, similar to Black 2 and White 2. Press the L Button while on the Key System Menu to access the Help System, which has detailed information on each key. Use the keys to change various settings about your game. Those settings are:
	*  __Version__: Switch between FireRed and LeafGreen to catch version-exclusive Pokémon.
	* __Difficulty__: Like in Black 2 and White 2, there is a Challenge and an Easy Mode difficulty. These difficulties scale trainer levels up or down, and in Challenge Mode important trainers will have an extra Pokémon and badge boosts are disabled.
	* __Nuzlocke Toggle__: Can toggle on a Nuzlocke mode. Press the L Button on the Key System menu to read the special ruleset for this mode.
	* __IV Calculation__: Can make the game treat your Pokémon's IVs as all perfect (31), all zero, or use their actual IVs as is standard for the purposes of stat calculation. This does not affect your Pokémon's actual IVs or Hidden Power, just how their stats are calculated. If set to all perfect, enemy Pokémon will also be treated as if they have all perfect IVs.
	* __EV Calculation__: Can make the game treat your Pokémon's EVs as all zero, or use their actual EVs as is standard for the purposes of stat calculation. This does not affect your Pokémon's actual EVs, (they will still gain/lose EVs as normal), just how their stats are calculated.
	* __No Free Heals__: Can disable free party heals, most notably the Pokémon Center heals and the Lavender Tower purified zone, but also many others. This also prevents PC Boxes from healing Pokémon deposited into them.
	* __Exp. Modifier__: Can alter experience gains using a multiplier. The possible options are 0×, 1/2×, 1×, and 2×. Pokémon still gain EVs normally when this is set to 0×.

##### Nuzlocke Info:
<details>
<summary>This is a special implementation of the Nuzlocke ruleset. While the Nuzlocke toggle is on (click for details):</summary>
<ul>
<li>Fainted Pokémon cannot be healed by any means (including depositing them in a PC Box).</li>
<li>The player is not asked whether or not they want to give a nickname to obtained Pokémon while Nuzlocke Mode is on.</li>
<li>Pokémon can be obtained at any time, but only the first Pokémon obtained in an area is usable barring duplicates (dupe clause).</li>
    <ul>
    <li>There is a UI element drawn to the enemy's healthbar to indicate if it counts as the first encounter in an area.</li>
   <li>Unusable Pokémon will be automatically fainted if received, and will not count as an encounter for the purposes of the built-in dupe clause.</li>
   <li>In-game trades will be fainted if the Pokémon traded for them was fainted but will be usable if not, and otherwise do not count as a first encounter.</li>
   <li>Eggs, when hatched, will set the encounter flag of the place the egg was first obtained. If that place already had a first encounter, then the egg will hatch fainted.</li>
   </ul>
<li>The Dupe Clause is in effect. Pokémon that are already owned, or evolutionary relatives of already owned Pokémon, will not count if they are the first encounter in an area and not caught.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>In-game trades do invoke the dupe clause for additional Pokémon of that species.</li>
    </ul>
<li>If a white out occurs, the player will be prompted to grab a usable Pokémon from their PC Box.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>If there are no usable Pokémon left, they will be given a choice of soft-resetting or turning off the Nuzlocke toggle and healing their party normally.</li>
    </ul>
<li>None of these rules come into effect until after the player obtains Poké Balls.</li>
<li>Encounters are not tracked:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>While the Nuzlocke toggle is off,</li>
    <li>retroactively (starting a Nuzlocke midway through a regular playthrough will allow new "first" encounters) and,</li>
    <li>before the player obtains the Pokédex, to prevent losing the opportunity to catch Route 1 Pokémon before catching Pokémon is possible.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Each outdoor Safari Zone map counts as a separate area for the purposes of catching Pokémon.</li>
<ul>
</details>

#### Story Changes:
- The player may progress to the Sevii Islands postgame content immediately after becoming the Champion; the National Dex is no longer required to do so.

	- The National Pokédex is now obtained by trading in a Pokémon that is not in the Extended Dex.

		* Clearing a Master Trainer confers a title that can be used in link battles with other FRLG+ players.
		* Clearing all 151 Master Trainers unlocks a secret superboss Trainer.

#### Quality of Life Changes:

##### Travel-related:
- Running indoors.
- Toggle auto running with the R button.
- Cut trees stay cut permanently.
- Hold B while surfing to go faster. If autorun is enabled, hold B to go slower, as the faster speed becomes default.
- The bike now has two gears, one for the default speed, and one for Mach Bike speed. Press B while biking to switch between them.
- The Victory Road boulder puzzles no longer reset.
- The two boulders that block access to Mt. Ember's exterior will no longer block the way once the player moves past them.
- Steps taken aren't counted while inside Safari Zone Rest Houses.
- The player travels at running speed while diving.
- The map fades in significantly faster after most warps, which makes entering and exiting doors faster.

##### Inventory and Item-related:
- Expanded item pockets. The player can hold one stack of every legally-obtainable item at once.
- Two new pockets, the Medicine and Held Items pockets, have been introduced to ease bag navigation.
- Press Start in the bag to sort items by several criteria.
- The bag pockets wrap around when switching between them.
- Left and Right in the TM Case and Berry Pouch scrolls faster.
- Infinite TM usage. TM prices have been modified to reflect this. TMs do not restore PP when learned, like in BW/B2W2.
	* The missable TM44 Rest from the S.S. Anne has been added to the Celadon Dept. Store inventory.
	* TM10 is no longer available through Pickup and is instead available in the Celadon Dept. Store.
- EV-reducing berries ported from Emerald (the Pomeg glitch was fixed during the port). Otherwise worthless berries obtainable as hidden items or through Pickup have been changed to these.

- The Generation III Poké Ball varieties can be purchased in Silph Co. after it has been liberated from Team Rocket.

##### Battle-related:
- New options available in the options menu to speed up battles:
	* Battle Transitions setting turns off the transition animation between the field and a battle.
	* Battle Intro Animation setting turns off the sliding animation that occurs at the start of every battle.
	* Battle Scene has been renamed to Move Animations and now also skips in-battle text delays when it is off.
	* HP Bar Animation Speed gives four options for how fast the HP bar animates, including instant.
	* Exp. Bar Animation Speed gives the player the choice to make experience bars animate instantly.

##### Move Tutor-related:
- There are eight new Move Tutors scattered throughout the world that teach Fury Cutter, Rollout, Dynamic Punch, Sleep Talk, Nightmare, Self-Destruct, Sky Attack, and Swagger respectively.
- Move Tutors will charge after the first time they teach a move, allowing infinite tutor uses at a cost. Frenzy Plant, Blast Burn, and Hydro Cannon can be tutored infinitely for free, and no longer have a friendship requirement to learn.
- The Move Reminder can overwrite HM moves with relearned moves.
- The Move Reminder can teach moves from a Pokémon's pre-evolutions, with some caveats.
	* If the Pokémon has a baby form, it can only relearn moves exclusive to that form if it was hatched itself. Wobbuffet from Mirage Island are the sole exception, as they were caught as Wynaut and therefore can also relearn Wynaut's exclusive moves.
	* If a Pokémon is not at a high enough level to learn a move from its own learnset, then it cannot relearn that move regardless of its presence in a pre-evolution's learnset.

##### User Interface-related:

##### Pokémon-related:

- No evolution restrictions; Pokémon will evolve regardless of whether or not their evolution is in the Kanto Dex.
	* Eevee evolves into Espeon by happiness outdoors and Umbreon by happiness indoors.
- The EV cap for an individual stat is 252, like in later generations.
- Pokémon that evolve by trade can evolve by using an unmissable Key Item on them that is obtained during the story. Pokémon like Scyther also need to be holding their evolution items to evolve in this way.
- Uncaptured legendary Pokémon, roaming Pokémon, and Snorlax will be regenerated upon entering the Hall of Fame, keeping them from being missable.
- If upon entering the Hall of Fame a legendary beast is not currently roaming, an uncaught one will begin to roam. This allows the player to capture all three legendary beasts in one playthrough.
- A woman in the Move Reminder's House on Two Island can check if a Pokémon is fully EV trained. If it is, she'll give it the Effort Ribbon.

##### Day Care-related:
- The Day-Care Man will raise his hand immediately if a Pokémon Egg is ready without having to transition to another map. He no longer steps forward to indicate an Egg is available.

- There is now a PC in the S.S. Anne in the room where the player can rest.

#### Vanilla Bug Fixes:
- All Revision 1 fixes are included here. This includes the missing "Presents" graphic in the intro, and several Pokédex errors and oversights.

- Fixed bug where the AI would decide to use Facade based on the target's status instead of its own.
- Fixed an oversight where Icefall Cave's cracked ice tiles could spawn wild encounters. If a wild encounter is generated on one, it does not crack, allowing the player to cheat the puzzle.
- Fixed the [evolution move-learning glitch](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Evolution_move-learning_glitch).
- Many vanilla tile errors have been fixed. Too many.

#### Miscellaneous Changes:
- All Kanto Pokémon, along with 90% of Johto Pokémon, will be available in one playthrough. All Hoenn Pokémon (except for Azurill, Wynaut, Latias, Latios, and Deoxys) will still need to be traded for.
- Abilities have effects in the overworld ported from Emerald.
	* As Lightningrod's Emerald overworld effect is inapplicable, it has been changed. Lightningrod now charges the Vs. Seeker twice as fast.
